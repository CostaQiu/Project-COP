COMPARISON: GEOMETRIC vs SIMPLE SUM ANNUAL RETURN CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

CALCULATION METHODS:
1. GEOMETRIC (Original):
   Annual Return = (1 + r1) × (1 + r2) × ... × (1 + r52) - 1
   (Accounts for compounding effect)

2. SIMPLE SUM (Alternative):
   Annual Return = r1 + r2 + ... + r52
   (Linear addition, no compounding)

Both methods use 10,000 bootstrap simulations with 52 weekly COP returns

KEY INSIGHTS & DIFFERENCES
================================================================================

1. MAGNITUDE OF RETURNS:
   - Geometric method produces HIGHER average returns (31.91% vs 27.75%)
   - Geometric compounds gains, creating multiplicative effect
   - Simple sum is linear without compounding benefit

2. VOLATILITY:
   - Simple sum has LOWER volatility (36.01% vs 48.57%)
   - Geometric method shows wider spread (higher standard deviation)
   - This is because compounding amplifies both positive and negative outcomes

3. TAIL BEHAVIOR:
   - EXTREME LOSSES: Simple sum worse (-119.32% vs -72.30% minimum)
   - EXTREME GAINS: Geometric method much better (327.16% vs 154.02%)
   - Simple sum is more "bounded" due to linear nature

4. DOWNSIDE RISK (P < 0%):
   - Simple sum: 21.81% probability of loss (BETTER)
   - Geometric: 27.26% probability of loss
   - Simple sum model is more conservative

5. UPSIDE OPPORTUNITY (P > 100%):
   - Geometric: 9.15% probability of doubling+ (BETTER)
   - Simple sum: 2.16% probability of doubling+
   - Geometric method offers more upside potential

6. MIDDLE GROUND (P < 50%):
   - Similar probabilities: 73.00% (simple) vs 70.32% (geometric)
   - Both show most scenarios result in < 50% annual return

================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION SHAPE
================================================================================

GEOMETRIC METHOD:
- Right-skewed (mean > median: 31.91% > 23.75%)
- Fat upper tail (outliers can be very large)
- Better captures compound growth potential
- More realistic for continuous compounding investments

SIMPLE SUM METHOD:
- More symmetric (mean ≈ median: 27.75% ≈ 27.63%)
- Bounded distribution
- Linear approximation only valid for small returns
- Less realistic but simpler to understand

================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL REASONING
================================================================================

Why Geometric > Simple Sum for typical returns?

For small returns r where |r| << 1:
(1 + r1) × (1 + r2) ≈ 1 + r1 + r2 + r1×r2
                     ≈ r1 + r2  (when r1×r2 is negligible)

But when returns accumulate:
52 positive returns create multiplicative gains in geometric method
(e.g., 52 × 0.5% weekly: Geometric ≈ 29% vs Simple = 26%)

However, extreme negative returns hurt more geometrically:
For r < 0: (1 + r) is bounded by 0, but simple sum unbounded downward
This creates the wider negative tail in simple sum

================================================================================
WHICH METHOD IS CORRECT?
================================================================================

GEOMETRIC METHOD (RECOMMENDED for most cases):
✓ Properly accounts for compounding
✓ More realistic for continuous investment growth
✓ Widely accepted in finance (IRR, CAGR, etc.)
✓ Matches actual investor experience if reinvesting

SIMPLE SUM METHOD (Limited use cases):
✓ Mathematically simpler
✓ Good approximation for very small returns only
✓ Useful for learning/teaching purposes
✗ Underestimates gains, overestimates losses
✗ Not realistic for actual portfolio returns

CONCLUSION:
For Question 5.2, the GEOMETRIC method is the theoretically correct approach
as it properly models how investment returns compound over time.
