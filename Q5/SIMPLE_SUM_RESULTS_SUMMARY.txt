PROBABILITY ANALYSIS - ANSWER TO QUESTION 5.2
================================================================================

Three Key Probabilities (SIMPLE SUM METHOD):

1. P(Annual Return > 100%):  2.16%   (216 out of 10,000 simulations)
   - Only 2.16% chance of doubling your money
   - Much lower than geometric method (9.15%)
   
2. P(Annual Return < 0%):   21.81%   (2,181 out of 10,000 simulations)
   - About 1 in 5 chance of losing money
   - Lower than geometric method (27.26%)
   
3. P(Annual Return < 50%):  73.00%   (7,300 out of 10,000 simulations)
   - About 73% of outcomes produce less than 50% return
   - Similar to geometric method (70.32%)

KEY DIFFERENCES:

1. Upside Potential:
   - Geometric offers 9.15% chance of >100% return
   - Simple sum offers only 2.16% chance
   - Geometric creates compounding gains

2. Downside Risk:
   - Simple sum shows worse minimum (-119% vs -72%)
   - But fewer scenarios with negative returns (21.81% vs 27.26%)

3. Volatility:
   - Simple sum has lower volatility (36.01% vs 48.57%)
   - More stable/predictable outcomes

4. Central Tendency:
   - Mean similar (31.91% vs 27.75%)
   - But geometric skewed right (mean > median)
   - Simple sum symmetric (mean ≈ median)

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

With Simple Sum Method ($100,000 initial investment):

EXPECTED VALUE:
- Mean expected return: 27.75%
- Expected portfolio value: $127,753

RANGE OF OUTCOMES:
- Best case: +154% → $254,019
- Worst case: -119% → -$119,323 (exceeds initial investment!)
- Most likely range: -31% to +88%

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- 21.81% probability of loss (still significant)
- 73% of cases produce <50% return
- Only 2.16% chance of doubling+ investment

COMPARISON TO GEOMETRIC:
- Simple sum is MORE CONSERVATIVE in upside
- Simple sum is SLIGHTLY BETTER on avoiding losses
- Simple sum has LOWER volatility overall

================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL NOTE
================================================================================

Why Simple Sum < Geometric for typical scenarios:

For positive weekly returns:
- Geometric: (1.005)^52 ≈ 1.319 = 31.9% annual return
- Simple: 52 × 0.005 = 0.26 = 26.0% annual return

Compounding effect = Geometric - Simple ≈ 5.9%

This explains why geometric method consistently shows higher average returns.

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The simple sum method provides a linear approximation to annual returns
without accounting for compounding effects. Results show:

ANSWER TO Q5.2 (Simple Sum Method):
- P(Return > 100%) = 2.16%
- P(Return < 0%)   = 21.81%
- P(Return < 50%)  = 73.00%

RECOMMENDATION:
For proper financial analysis, use the GEOMETRIC method as it correctly
models how investments actually compound. The simple sum method is provided
for comparison purposes only.

To switch back to geometric method in the Python script:
1. Comment out the "annual_return = np.sum(sampled_returns)" line
2. Uncomment the "annual_return = np.prod(1 + sampled_returns) - 1" line
3. Re-run the script
