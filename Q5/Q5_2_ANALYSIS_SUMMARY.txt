QUESTION 5.2: BOOTSTRAP MONTE CARLO SIMULATION ANALYSIS
Bootstrap Annual Return Estimation (Without Normality Assumption)
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Extracted 260 weekly returns from COP (historical data)
2. Performed 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations
3. Each simulation:
   - Randomly selected 52 weekly returns WITH REPLACEMENT (bootstrap)
   - Calculated annual return using geometric formula:
     Annual Return = (1+r1) × (1+r2) × ... × (1+r52) - 1
4. Analyzed distribution of 10,000 annual returns

================================================================================
INPUT DATA SUMMARY (COP Weekly Returns)
================================================================================
Number of observations:        260 weeks
Mean weekly return:            0.5357% (0.005357)
Standard deviation (weekly):   4.9684% (0.049684)
Minimum weekly return:        -19.7638% (-0.197638)
Maximum weekly return:         15.8003% (0.158003)

Note: Using historical bootstrap instead of normal distribution assumption
      (addressing the normality concern from Question 5.1)

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION RESULTS (10,000 iterations)
================================================================================

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
  Mean Annual Return:         31.91%
  Median Annual Return:       23.75%
  Standard Deviation:         48.57%
  Minimum Annual Return:     -72.30%
  Maximum Annual Return:     327.16%

PERCENTILE DISTRIBUTION:

  5th percentile:    -31.78%
  10th percentile:   -22.77%
  25th percentile:    -2.37%
  50th percentile:    23.75% (Median)
  75th percentile:    58.46%
  90th percentile:    95.68%
  95th percentile:   126.13%
  99th percentile:   181.60%

KEY PROBABILITY FINDINGS (Answer to Question 5.2)
================================================================================

P(Annual Return > 100%):    9.15%   (915 out of 10,000)
P(Annual Return < 0%):     27.26%   (2,726 out of 10,000)
P(Annual Return < 50%):    70.32%   (7,032 out of 10,000)

================================================================================
COMPARISON: QUESTION 5.1 vs QUESTION 5.2
================================================================================

Question 5.1 (Normal Distribution Assumption):
  - Assumes market returns follow normal distribution
  - Uses parameters estimated from 5-year historical S&P 500 data
  
Question 5.2 (Bootstrap Approach):
  - No normality assumption required
  - Resamples directly from historical COP returns
  - Preserves empirical distribution of actual returns
  - Better captures tail behavior and non-normal features

KEY DIFFERENCES IN RESULTS:
  - Bootstrap approach likely shows different probabilities due to:
    * Historical COP returns may have different mean/volatility than S&P 500
    * Bootstrap captures actual fat tails and skewness
    * No assumption of symmetry (unlike normal distribution)

OUTPUT FILES
================================================================================

1. bootstrap_annual_returns.csv
   - Contains 10,001 rows (header + 10,000 simulations)
   - Columns: Simulation_Number, Annual_Return
   - Each annual return represents one Monte Carlo iteration
   - Can be used for further analysis, visualization, or backtesting

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

The bootstrap analysis shows:

1. CENTRAL TENDENCY:
   Mean annual return of 31.91% suggests positive expected returns from COP
   However, median of 23.75% indicates right skew (positive outliers)

2. DOWNSIDE RISK:
   27.26% probability of negative returns signals significant downside risk
   This is substantial and should not be overlooked

3. UPSIDE POTENTIAL:
   Only 9.15% probability of doubling money (>100% return)
   70.32% of scenarios result in <50% annual return

4. VOLATILITY:
   48.57% standard deviation indicates high variability
   Wide range from -72.30% to +327.16% shows diverse outcomes

5. RISK-RETURN PROFILE:
   For an initial $100,000 investment:
   - Expected value after 1 year: ~$131,913
   - But with high uncertainty and 27.26% chance of loss
   - Could range from -$72,300 (loss) to +$327,156 (gain)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The bootstrap Monte Carlo simulation provides a data-driven approach to
investment analysis that doesn't rely on normality assumptions. The results
suggest moderate positive expected returns for COP but with substantial
volatility and downside risk. Investors should consider their risk tolerance
and time horizon when evaluating such outcomes.
